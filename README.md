# ClassMap & ClassWrite (Classroom Collaboration Platform)

Classroom Portal is a real-time, interactive collaboration platform designed for classroom sessions. It provides two distinct modes to suit different activities:
- **ClassMap**: A map-based activity where participants drop pins and notes on a shared map.
- **ClassWrite**: A board-based activity where participants share thoughts in a structured post-list format.

## Features
- **Real-time Collaboration**: Synchronize pins, notes, and posts across all clients instantly using Socket.IO.
- **Dual Activity Modes**: Choose between a Map view for spatial activities or a Board view for discussions and sharing.
- **Media Uploads**: Attach images and videos to your contributions with inline preview and playback.
- **YouTube Integration**: Paste a YouTube URL to automatically embed the video player in your note or post.
- **Hierarchy Management**: Administrators can manage multiple Classes, each containing separate active Sessions.
- **Unified UI**: A sleek, modern interface with a consistent header system and responsive design across all views.
- **Easy Network Access**: The server automatically detects local IPs, making it easy for students to join via their mobile devices on the same Wi-Fi.
